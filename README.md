# Basic Markdown Site with frontmatter

Uses node to turn markdown into html, CSS, and JS ready to serve as a static site.

## Using this project

- All the content on the site is kept in the `md` folder; the structure of this folder will be reflected in the site structure.
- Any file placed in `/public` will be served, e.g. `public/script.js` is available at the url `/script.js`
